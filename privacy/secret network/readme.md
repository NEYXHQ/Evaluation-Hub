# Secret Network Gray Paper Summary

## Overview
The Secret Network Gray Paper outlines the privacy-centric blockchain, emphasizing "programmable privacy" powered by Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) like Intel SGX. It covers how data privacy is ensured during computation on the blockchain.

## Architecture
Leveraging the Cosmos SDK for modularity and interoperability, Secret Network supports advanced decentralized applications with confidential smart contracts.

## Features
## Privacy and Security
Secret Network enhances privacy by using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), specifically Intel SGX, to secure data during execution. Data remains encrypted both at rest and in use, ensuring that sensitive computations can occur without exposing the underlying data. This unique approach supports the creation of confidential smart contracts, where input and output data are kept secret.

## Governance and Tokenomics
The network operates with a decentralized governance model allowing stakeholders to participate in decision-making. The native token, SCRT, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance voting. Staking SCRT not only secures the network but also aligns the incentives of various network participants. The economic model is designed to ensure long-term viability and network security.

## Applications
The privacy features of Secret Network open it up to a wide array of applications, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) where user confidentiality is paramount. Additionally, the network can support private voting systems, secret auctions, and other applications that require data privacy without sacrificing blockchain's inherent transparency.
