# 03 - Adaptive Conformal Consensus for Provable Blockchain Oracles

## Abstract
This paper introduces the Adaptive Conformal Consensus (ACon2) algorithm aimed at addressing the oracle problem in blockchain environments. ACon2 provides a consensus mechanism on external data inputs to smart contracts, enhancing security against distribution shifts and Byzantine adversaries. This work underscores the potential of integrating online machine learning algorithms with blockchain technology to maintain consistent block-state information and robust security standards.

## Introduction
The paper explores the importance of oracles in blockchains, which serve as bridges between deterministic blockchain operations and the stochastic off-chain world. The challenges inherent in current oracle mechanisms include vulnerability to data manipulation, which threatens the consistency of the blockchain's ledger. The proposed ACon2 algorithm leverages adaptive conformal prediction techniques to generate reliable data consensus among multiple oracle sources.

## Key Contributions
- **Adaptive Conformal Consensus (ACon2):** A novel algorithm that derives consensus from multiple data sources under the framework of online uncertainty quantification learning.
- **Correctness Guarantee:** ACon2 provides correctness guarantees, maintaining reliable oracle services even in the presence of adversarial data manipulation.
- **Implementation and Evaluation:** The paper includes an Ethereum case study demonstrating the practical applicability and effectiveness of the ACon2 algorithm, implemented in Solidity.

## Use Case and Evaluation
The efficacy of ACon2 is demonstrated using two price datasets and an Ethereum-based case study. The results show that the algorithm can achieve desired miscoverage rates, effectively handle distribution shifts, and protect against Byzantine faults in a real-world blockchain setting.

## Conclusion
ACon2 represents a significant step forward in resolving the oracle problem in blockchain systems. By integrating advanced machine learning techniques, ACon2 ensures that smart contracts interact with external data sources in a secure and reliable manner, thereby enhancing the overall robustness of blockchain applications.
