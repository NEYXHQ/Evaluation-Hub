## Comments on paper: zkSNARKs in a Nutshell

[zkSNARKs in a nutshell](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/05/zksnarks-in-a-nutshell/) is a great introductory article for people unfamiliar with zero knowledge proofs. 
Here is GPT summary

## coding as a Polynomial Problem:
Transforming statements to be proven into mathematical forms (polynomial equations).

## Succinctness through Random Sampling: 
Making proofs shorter and quicker to verify by using random sampling techniques.

## Homomorphic Encoding/Encryption: 
Allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data, maintaining privacy while proving that the computation was done correctly.

## Zero-Knowledge: 
The prover can convince the verifier that a statement is true without revealing any specific information about the statement itself.
