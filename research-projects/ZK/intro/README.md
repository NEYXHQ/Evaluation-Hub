## Comments on paper: zkSNARKs in a Nutshell

[zkSNARKs in a nutshell](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/05/zksnarks-in-a-nutshell/) is a great introductory article for people unfamiliar with zero knowledge proofs. 
Here is GPT summary

## coding as a Polynomial Problem:
Transforming statements to be proven into mathematical forms (polynomial equations).

## Succinctness through Random Sampling: 
Making proofs shorter and quicker to verify by using random sampling techniques.

## Homomorphic Encoding/Encryption: 
Allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data, maintaining privacy while proving that the computation was done correctly.

## Zero-Knowledge: 
The prover can convince the verifier that a statement is true without revealing any specific information about the statement itself.

The possibilities of zkSNARKs are impressive; you can verify the correctness of computations without having to execute them, and you will not even learn what was executed – just that it was done correctly. Unfortunately, most explanations of zkSNARKs resort to hand-waving at some point, and thus they remain something “magical”, suggesting that only the most enlightened actually understand how and why (and if?) they work. The reality is that zkSNARKs can be reduced to four simple techniques, and this article aims to explain them. Anyone who can understand how the RSA cryptosystem works, should also get a pretty good understanding of currently employed zkSNARKs.

## Part 1
RSA encryption and its pivotal role in zero-knowledge proofs, a concept integral to zkSNARKs. It elucidates RSA's homomorphic properties, enabling encrypted data verification without exposing the original values. The section demonstrates how a prover can validate computations through encrypted messages, ensuring the verifier learns only the result's correctness, not the data itself. This principle is foundational for understanding zkSNARKs, as it illustrates how cryptographic techniques can underpin privacy-preserving verification processes, crucial for secure and confidential blockchain transactions and computational validations.

## Part 2
NP and complexity-theoretic reductions, crucial for understanding the applicability of zkSNARKs in computational problems. Here's a summary of this section:

1. **P and NP Classes**
The document explains the complexity classes P and NP. P includes problems that can be solved in polynomial time, while NP comprises problems for which solutions can be verified in polynomial time. It's noted that every problem in P is also in NP, but the opposite is not proven.
2. **NP-Completeness and SAT**
The document introduces the concept of NP-completeness, with SAT (Boolean satisfiability problem) highlighted as a quintessential NP-complete problem. This section explains how any problem in NP can be reduced to SAT, demonstrating the universality and significance of NP-complete problems.
3. **Reductions and Witnesses**
Through reductions, one problem can be transformed into another, maintaining their solution equivalence. This transformation is crucial for zkSNARKs, as it allows complex computational problems to be converted into a standard form that zkSNARKs can handle. The concept of a "witness" is introduced, which is essentially additional information that helps verify a solution to an NP problem.
3. **P = NP?**
he document touches on the famous P vs. NP problem, highlighting its significance and the massive implications of solving this problem, particularly for fields like cryptography and blockchain.
5. **Application to zkSNARKs**
The discussion connects these theoretical concepts to zkSNARKs, explaining how understanding NP and reductions is vital for implementing zkSNARKs effectively. zkSNARKs are applicable to all problems in NP, underscoring their broad potential in verifying computations efficiently and securely.

## Part 3

1. **Quadratic Span Programs (QSPs)**: The section introduces QSPs as a specific problem type suited for zkSNARKs. A QSP involves a set of polynomials, and the task is to find a linear combination of these polynomials that is a multiple of a given target polynomial. The polynomials and the combinations are structured in a way that they correspond to the computation or problem being verified.

2. **Structure of QSPs**: A QSP is defined over a field F and involves polynomials \(v_0, \ldots, v_m\) and \(w_0, \ldots, w_m\), along with a target polynomial \(t\). The function \(f\) maps input bits to indices of these polynomials, which helps encode the problem being verified into the QSP format.

3. **Acceptance Criteria**: The section details how an input is considered accepted by a QSP based on the existence of specific tuples that satisfy certain conditions, ultimately ensuring that the target polynomial \(t\) divides the product of two constructed polynomials from the \(v_i\) and \(w_i\) sets.

4. **Relevance to Cryptography and zkSNARKs**: The discussion then ties QSPs to the broader context of zkSNARKs, explaining how they provide a suitable structure for encoding computational problems in a way that's compatible with the zkSNARK framework. This encoding is crucial for the verification process in zkSNARKs, where proving knowledge of a solution to a QSP correlates to proving the correctness of a computation without revealing the details.

This section is essential for understanding how complex computational problems are translated into a mathematical structure that zkSNARKs can work with, enabling efficient verification of computations without revealing the computation details or the inputs used.
