# Zero-Knowledge Proof Research

## Overview

This folder, `ZK`, is dedicated to hosting all research and resources related to Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). Zero-Knowledge Proofs are a revolutionary cryptographic method that enables one party to prove to another party that they know a value x, without conveying any information apart from the fact that they know the value x.

## Purpose

The aim of this directory is to gather, organize, and share materials, code snippets, documents, and any relevant resources that contribute to the understanding and development of Zero-Knowledge Proof technologies.

## Structure

- `/papers` - Academic and industry research papers on ZKP.
- `/implementations` - Sample code, libraries, and frameworks related to ZKP.
- `/docs` - Documentation, tutorials, and explanatory materials.
- `/presentations` - Slides, talks, and seminar materials.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you have any research, resources, or insights related to Zero-Knowledge Proofs, please feel free to add them to this repository. Ensure that your contributions are well-documented and include any necessary references or acknowledgments.

This folder is a collaborative effort to advance the understanding and implementation of Zero-Knowledge Proofs. Your contributions and insights are highly valued.
