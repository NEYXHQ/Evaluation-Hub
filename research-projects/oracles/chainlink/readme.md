# ChainLink v1.0: A Decentralized Oracle Network

## Overview

ChainLink addresses the critical problem of smart contracts on blockchain being unable to interact with external data securely. It introduces a decentralized network of oracles that allows blockchain to securely interact with external data feeds, web APIs, and traditional bank payments.

## Features

- **Decentralized Oracles**: Provides a way to decentralize the point of control, reducing risks associated with having a single point of failure.
- **Secure Node Operators**: Utilizes a network of secure node operators, which are thoroughly vetted through a comprehensive security audit process.
- **On-Chain and Off-Chain Process**: Explains both the on-chain and off-chain architecture that ChainLink uses to provide data to smart contracts.
- **Oracle Security**: Focuses on ensuring the authenticity and confidentiality of data provided by oracles.

## Technical Highlights

- **Dual Architectures**: Explains the dual architecture involving on-chain components for data agreement and off-chain components for data retrieval.
- **Decentralization Strategies**: Discusses distribution of data sources and oracles, using multiple nodes and sources to ensure data accuracy and security.
- **Security Services**: Describes several proposed security services like Validation System, Reputation System, and Contract-Upgrade Service to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of oracle services.

## Long-Term Vision

- **Confidentiality and Trusted Hardware**: Proposes future improvements that include confidentiality through trusted hardware, like Intel SGX, and additional infrastructure changes to support secure oracle operations.
- **Richly Featured Oracle Programming**: Envisions enabling more complex off-chain computations and interactions within smart contracts facilitated by oracles.

## Conclusion

ChainLink aims to provide a reliable, tamper-proof network of oracles that is vital for the

# Chainlink v2.0: Next Steps in the Evolution of Decentralized Oracle Networks

## Introduction

Chainlink 2.0 builds on the original framework of Chainlink, enhancing its capabilities as a decentralized oracle network (DON). The whitepaper articulates the vision for an expanded role of DONs in providing secure, fast, and confidential universal connectivity and computation for hybrid smart contracts.

## Key Innovations

- **Hybrid Smart Contracts**: Enhances the functionality of smart contracts by securely integrating both on-chain and off-chain computations.
- **Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs)**: Proposes a modular, scalable framework allowing multiple oracle functions to be executed on a decentralized network.
- **Scaling Solutions**: Emphasizes developments to meet high-performance demands with minimal latency and robust confidentiality measures.
- **Trust Minimization**: Focuses on decentralization and cryptographic techniques to reduce trust assumptions and increase security.
- **Incentive Models**: Introduces cryptoeconomic strategies ensuring reliable and correct data from nodes, even under adversarial conditions.
- **Confidentiality**: Develops new methods for data privacy, including adaptations of DECO and Town Crier for confidential data retrieval and computation.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Security Model**: Outlines a robust security framework tailored to the needs of decentralized applications.
- **Advanced Off-Chain Computation**: Supports complex off-chain computations and interactions between different systems, enhancing the utility and efficiency of smart contracts.
- **Fair Sequencing Services (FSS)**: Addresses transaction ordering issues to prevent front-running and other exploitative practices by network participants.

## Vision and Future Directions

The document discusses the long-term goals of creating a more interconnected and efficient blockchain ecosystem through Chainlink 2.0. Future updates aim to further integrate new blockchain technologies and expand the scope of oracle services.

## Conclusion

Chainlink 2.0 seeks to significantly advance the functionality and applicability of oracle networks, fostering broader adoption and more dynamic applications in the decentralized space.
